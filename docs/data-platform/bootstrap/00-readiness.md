# Data Platform Bootstrap Readiness Assessment

## Overview

This document defines the readiness criteria for deploying a production-grade lakehouse data platform using Apache Iceberg + Trino + Spark Operator on the Anton Kubernetes homelab.

## Trigger Conditions

The data platform bootstrap should be initiated when **ANY** of the following conditions are met:

### Storage & Scale Triggers
- [ ] **Storage Usage**: Current PVC usage exceeds 200Gi total
- [ ] **Data Processing**: Manual ETL scripts or data transformations are being performed
- [ ] **Analytics Requirements**: Need for analytical queries on datasets > 1GB

### Infrastructure Triggers  
- [ ] **S3 Storage**: Requirement for S3-compatible object storage for applications
- [ ] **Distributed Processing**: Need for multi-node batch processing capabilities
- [ ] **Interactive Analytics**: Requirement for sub-10 second query response times

### Business Triggers
- [ ] **Data Pipeline Automation**: Manual data workflows need orchestration
- [ ] **Multi-format Data**: Need to handle Parquet, Delta, or other analytical formats
- [ ] **Historical Analysis**: Requirements for time travel or versioned data access

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] **Ceph Storage**: Operational with S3-compatible RADOS Gateway
  ```bash
  kubectl get cephobjectstore -n storage storage -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
  # Expected: "Ready"
  ```
- [ ] **Available Resources**: At least 60GB RAM and 6 CPU cores available across cluster
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  # Verify <70% memory and CPU utilization
  ```
- [ ] **Airflow Orchestration**: Functional Airflow deployment for workflow management
  ```bash
  kubectl get helmrelease -n airflow airflow -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[0].type}'
  # Expected: "Ready"
  ```

### Operational Requirements
- [ ] **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus/Grafana operational for observability
- [ ] **GitOps Foundation**: Flux deployment and reconciliation working
- [ ] **Secret Management**: External Secrets Operator or alternative available

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- [ ] **Team Familiarity**: Basic understanding of SQL and data concepts
- [ ] **Kubernetes Administration**: Ability to debug pods, services, and storage
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Understanding of data backup and recovery procedures

## Current State Assessment

### Storage Infrastructure
```bash
# Check Ceph cluster health
kubectl -n storage exec deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph status

# Verify S3 gateway endpoints
kubectl get svc -n storage | grep rgw

# Test S3 API compatibility
aws s3 --endpoint-url http://$(kubectl get svc -n storage rook-ceph-rgw-storage -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'):80 ls
```

### Resource Availability
```bash
# Check node resources
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocated resources"

# Review current PVC usage
kubectl get pvc -A --no-headers | awk '{print $4}' | grep -v "<none>" | numfmt --from=iec --to=iec --suffix=B

# Verify available storage classes
kubectl get storageclass
```

### Dependencies Status
```bash
# Flux system health
flux get all -A | grep -v "True"

# Airflow operational status
kubectl get pods -n airflow | grep airflow

# Monitoring availability
kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep prometheus
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Impact Risks
- **Resource Contention**: Data platform may consume 60-70% of cluster resources
- **Storage Bandwidth**: Ceph performance may become bottleneck for analytics workloads
- **Complexity**: Multi-component architecture increases operational overhead

### Medium Impact Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Team familiarity with Spark, Trino, and Iceberg required
- **Backup Complexity**: Metadata and data consistency across components
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Additional metrics and alerting requirements

### Low Impact Risks
- **Version Compatibility**: Chart versions and API compatibility
- **Network Performance**: Inter-pod communication for distributed queries

## Mitigation Strategies

### Resource Management
- Implement resource quotas and limits
- Use pod priority classes for critical workloads
- Monitor resource utilization with automated alerting

### Performance Optimization
- Configure Ceph S3 Select for query pushdown
- Implement data partitioning strategies
- Use columnar storage formats (Parquet)

### Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Automated backup and recovery procedures
- Documentation and runbook creation

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success (Foundation)
- [ ] Hive Metastore operational with 99.9% uptime
- [ ] S3 + Iceberg table creation and querying functional
- [ ] Metadata backup and recovery validated

### Phase 2 Success (Compute)
- [ ] Spark Operator deployed and managing job lifecycle
- [ ] Sample PySpark jobs executing successfully
- [ ] Integration with Airflow DAGs working

### Phase 3 Success (Analytics)
- [ ] Trino cluster processing analytical queries
- [ ] Query response times under 10 seconds for 10GB datasets
- [ ] Multi-table joins executing across Iceberg catalog

### Overall Success
- [ ] End-to-end data pipeline: ingestion → processing → analytics
- [ ] Performance targets achieved (2.5x improvement with S3 Select)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting covering all components
- [ ] Documentation and operational procedures complete

## Decision Matrix

| Condition | Met | Priority | Action |
|-----------|-----|----------|--------|
| Storage > 200Gi | ❓ | High | Check current PVC usage |
| S3 Requirements | ❓ | High | Validate application needs |
| Analytics Needs | ❓ | Medium | Assess query requirements |
| Resources Available | ❓ | Critical | Review cluster capacity |

## Next Steps

1. **Assess Current State**: Run readiness checks above
2. **Evaluate Triggers**: Determine which conditions apply
3. **Resource Planning**: Validate sufficient cluster capacity
4. **Team Preparation**: Ensure knowledge prerequisites met

**If readiness criteria are met, proceed to**: `01-foundation.md`

**If not ready**: Document blocking issues and remediation plan
