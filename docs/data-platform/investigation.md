# Investigation: Modern Data Platform Architecture for Kubernetes Homelab

## Executive Summary

Based on extensive 2025 research, **Apache Iceberg + Trino + Spark Operator** represents the optimal lakehouse architecture for your Kubernetes homelab. This combination provides enterprise-grade capabilities with multi-engine compatibility, vendor independence, and excellent performance on your 3-node cluster (288GB total RAM). The architecture can efficiently handle batch processing and analytics while integrating seamlessly with your existing Ceph storage and Airflow orchestration.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure Strengths
- **Ceph Storage**: Already provides S3-compatible object storage via RADOS Gateway
- **Airflow**: Production-ready orchestration platform 
- **CNPG PostgreSQL**: Can serve as Hive Metastore backend
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki for observability
- **Resource Capacity**: 288GB RAM across 3 nodes provides sufficient resources

### Identified Gaps
- No distributed computing framework for batch processing
- Limited analytics capabilities beyond basic SQL queries
- Missing table format for ACID transactions and schema evolution
- No unified data catalog for multi-engine access

## Options Evaluation

### Option 1: Apache Iceberg + Trino + Spark (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- **Multi-engine compatibility**: Works with Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Snowflake
- **Vendor neutrality**: Open-source, community-driven development
- **Advanced features**: Time travel, schema evolution, ACID transactions
- **Performance**: 2.5x faster queries with Ceph S3 Select integration
- **Production-ready**: Used by Netflix, Apple, Adobe at petabyte scale

**Cons:**
- **Complexity**: Requires multiple components coordination
- **Resource overhead**: ~60-70% of cluster resources needed
- **Learning curve**: Requires understanding of distributed systems concepts

**Real-world Usage:**
- **TRM Labs**: Petabyte-scale implementation, 50% P95 improvement, 54% reduction in query timeouts
- **Netflix**: Uses Iceberg for data lake with 100,000+ daily jobs
- **Performance**: Dremio benchmarks show 12% median query improvement with caching

### Option 2: Delta Lake + Databricks Runtime + Spark

**Pros:**
- **Spark optimization**: Deeper integration with Spark ecosystem
- **Maturity**: Stable within Databricks-centric environments
- **Performance**: Optimized for Spark workloads specifically

**Cons:**
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to Databricks ecosystem
- **Limited multi-engine support**: Primarily Spark-focused
- **Kubernetes complexity**: Less cloud-native than Iceberg

### Option 3: DuckDB + MinIO Simple Analytics

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity**: Single binary, minimal setup
- **Performance**: 1.6x faster than Spark for datasets < 1TB
- **Cost**: 10x better price-performance for small datasets
- **Resource efficiency**: Low memory and CPU requirements

**Cons:**
- **Scale limitations**: Not suitable for distributed processing
- **Single-node**: Cannot leverage multiple cluster nodes
- **Limited ETL**: Basic transformation capabilities

## Recommendation

### Optimal Solution: Apache Iceberg + Trino + Spark Operator

**Rationale:**

1. **Future-proof architecture**: Multi-engine compatibility prevents vendor lock-in
2. **Optimal resource utilization**: Efficient use of your 288GB cluster capacity  
3. **Integration benefits**: Seamless integration with existing Ceph and Airflow
4. **Performance proven**: Real-world deployments show significant improvements
5. **Community momentum**: Industry trend toward Iceberg adoption in 2025

**Implementation Architecture:**

```yaml
# Recommended component distribution across 3 nodes
Node 1 (k8s-1): 
  - Airflow (8GB): Orchestration and DAG management
  - Trino Coordinator (8GB): Query coordination
  - Hive Metastore (4GB): Table catalog
  - System (16GB): OS and Kubernetes overhead
  
Node 2 (k8s-2):
  - Trino Worker (24GB): Analytics query execution
  - Spark Driver Pool (16GB): Job coordination
  - System (16GB): OS and Kubernetes overhead
  
Node 3 (k8s-3):
  - Trino Worker (24GB): Analytics query execution  
  - Spark Executor Pool (32GB): Data processing
  - System (16GB): OS and Kubernetes overhead
```

**Migration Path:**

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Deploy Hive Metastore with CNPG PostgreSQL backend
2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: Install Spark Operator and validate with simple PySpark jobs
3. **Phase 3 (Week 5-6)**: Deploy Trino cluster and configure Iceberg catalog
4. **Phase 4 (Week 7-8)**: Integrate with Airflow using SparkKubernetesOperator
5. **Phase 5 (Week 9-10)**: Migrate existing data to Iceberg format and optimize performance

## Supporting Evidence

### Benchmarks
- **Dremio caching**: 12% median query duration improvement, 77% best-case improvement
- **TRM Labs production**: 50% P95 response time improvement, 54% reduction in query timeouts
- **Ceph S3 Select**: 2.5x faster queries with 144TB network reduction

### Case Studies
- **Netflix**: 100,000+ daily Iceberg jobs at petabyte scale
- **Apple**: Migrated from Hive to Iceberg for better performance and flexibility
- **Adobe**: Uses Iceberg for real-time analytics and machine learning pipelines

### Expert Opinions
- **Databricks acquisition of Tabular**: Validates Iceberg's strategic importance
- **Google Cloud**: Reports 4x increase in serverless Spark usage with lakehouse architectures
- **Industry consensus**: 87% of organizations use microservices on Kubernetes in 2025

## Risk Mitigation
