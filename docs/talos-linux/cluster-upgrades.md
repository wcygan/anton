# Upgrade Talos and Kubernetes

This guide outlines the process for upgrading Talos OS and Kubernetes versions for your cluster.

**Key Principles:**

*   **One Node at a Time for OS Upgrades:** Always upgrade the Talos OS on one node at a time. Wait for the node to successfully reboot, rejoin the cluster, and report as `Ready` before proceeding to the next. This maintains cluster stability, especially for control plane nodes.
*   **Two-Phase Upgrade:** The process involves first upgrading the Talos OS on all nodes, and then upgrading the Kubernetes version across the cluster.
*   **Configuration Regeneration:** After changing versions in `talos/talenv.yaml`, always regenerate the Talos machine configurations.
*   **Staging vs. Upgrading:** `apply-node` stages changes without reboot; `upgrade-node` initiates the OS upgrade and reboot.

## Phase 1: Upgrade Talos OS

1.  **Update Talos Version in `talos/talenv.yaml`:**
    Modify the `talosVersion` to your target version. For example, to upgrade to Talos v1.10.0:
    ```diff
    # renovate: datasource=docker depName=ghcr.io/siderolabs/installer
    - talosVersion: v1.9.1
    + talosVersion: v1.10.0
    # renovate: datasource=docker depName=ghcr.io/siderolabs/kubelet
    kubernetesVersion: v1.32.0
    ```

2.  **Regenerate Talos Configuration:**
    This updates the machine configuration files based on the new Talos version.
    ```bash
    task talos:generate-config
    ```

3.  **Apply Configuration to Each Node:**
    This step stages the configuration changes on each node but does *not* perform the OS upgrade or reboot them.
    ```bash
    task talos:apply-node IP=192.168.1.98 MODE=auto
    task talos:apply-node IP=192.168.1.99 MODE=auto
    task talos:apply-node IP=192.168.1.100 MODE=auto
    ```
    You will see "Applied configuration without a reboot" for each.

    **Note:** `MODE=auto` applies the configuration without reboot. To apply and reboot immediately, use `MODE=reboot`:
    ```bash
    task talos:apply-node IP=192.168.1.98 MODE=reboot
    ```

    In general, I recommend using `MODE=auto` for all nodes.

4.  **Upgrade Talos OS on Each Node (Sequentially):**
    This command initiates the actual OS upgrade. The node will download the new Talos image, install it, and reboot.
    Monitor each node's progress (e.g., using `talosctl dashboard` or `kubectl get nodes -w`).

    *   Upgrade the first node:
        ```bash
        task talos:upgrade-node IP=192.168.1.98
        ```
        Wait for it to complete and be `Ready`.

    *   Upgrade the second node:
        ```bash
        task talos:upgrade-node IP=192.168.1.99
        ```
        Wait for it to complete and be `Ready`.

    *   Upgrade the third node:
        ```bash
        task talos:upgrade-node IP=192.168.1.100
        ```
        Wait for it to complete and be `Ready`.

## Phase 2: Upgrade Kubernetes Version

Once all nodes are successfully running the new Talos OS version:

1.  **Update Kubernetes Version in `talos/talenv.yaml`:**
    Modify the `kubernetesVersion` to your target version. For example, to upgrade to Kubernetes v1.33.0 (ensure this version is compatible with your Talos OS version by checking the [Talos support matrix](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/introduction/support-matrix/)):
    ```diff
    # renovate: datasource=docker depName=ghcr.io/siderolabs/installer
    talosVersion: v1.10.0 # Should reflect the version from Phase 1
    # renovate: datasource=docker depName=ghcr.io/siderolabs/kubelet
    - kubernetesVersion: v1.32.0 # Or your current version
    + kubernetesVersion: v1.33.0
    ```

2.  **Regenerate Talos Configuration:**
    This updates machine configurations to prepare for the Kubernetes upgrade.
    ```bash
    task talos:generate-config
    ```

3.  **Perform Kubernetes Upgrade:**
    This command orchestrates the Kubernetes upgrade across the cluster.
    ```bash
    task talos:upgrade-k8s
    ```
    Monitor the upgrade progress. This process is designed to be non-disruptive to workloads.

## Monitoring

You can monitor the state of your nodes and the cluster using:
```bash
# For a live dashboard of all nodes
talosctl dashboard --nodes 192.168.1.98,192.168.1.99,192.168.1.100

# Or if your talosconfig is set up for the cluster endpoint
talosctl dashboard

# To watch Kubernetes node status
kubectl get nodes -w
```

### Verification: Kubernetes Version

After the cluster upgrade completes, verify the Kubernetes version on each node:
```bash
kubectl version --short
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
