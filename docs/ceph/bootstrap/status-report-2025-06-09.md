# Ceph Implementation Status Report
Generated: 2025-06-09

## Executive Summary

The Ceph distributed storage bootstrap initiative is **actively progressing** with significant milestones achieved. The cluster is operational and healthy, with initial workload migrations underway.

### Current Phase: 4.2 - Workload Migration
- **Overall Progress**: 75% complete (Phases 0-3 completed, Phase 4 in progress)
- **Trigger Status**: Storage usage threshold (100Gi) was met with 116Gi total usage
- **Cluster Health**: HEALTH_OK with all 6 OSDs operational
- **Migration Progress**: 2 of 5 workloads successfully migrated to Ceph

## Detailed Status by Phase

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Pre-Implementation Monitoring (Completed)
- **Trigger Activated**: Storage usage exceeded 100Gi threshold (116Gi total)
- **Backup Decision**: Skipped per user direction - proceeding without backups

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Completed)
- **Hardware Validation**: All 3 nodes ready with RBD kernel modules
- **Storage Devices**: 6x 1TB NVMe drives prepared (2 per node)
- **GitOps Structure**: Complete with phased deployment strategy

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Rook-Ceph Deployment (Completed)
- **Operator**: v1.17.4 running successfully
- **Cluster Status**: HEALTH_OK with 3-way replication
- **Block Storage**: Default storage class "ceph-block" operational
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards and Prometheus rules deployed

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Optional Components (Prepared)
- **CephFS**: Ready for activation when RWX needed (currently disabled)
- **Object Storage**: Ready for activation when S3 needed (currently disabled)
- **Note**: MDS and RGW pools exist but services are minimal until activated

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Production Migration (In Progress)

#### 4.1 Migration Planning ‚úÖ (Completed 2025-06-09)
- Comprehensive migration plan created
- Volsync templates and procedures documented
- Test scripts developed

#### 4.2 Workload Migration ‚è≥ (Active)
**Completed Migrations (2/5):**
1. **test-cache** (DragonflyDB) - 1Gi - Migrated to ceph-block
2. **test-postgres-cluster** (CNPG) - 5Gi - Migrated to ceph-block

**Remaining Migrations (3/5):**
1. **data-airflow-postgresql-0** - 8Gi - Requires Helm values update
2. **logs-airflow-triggerer-0** - 100Gi - Requires Helm values update  
3. **open-webui** - 2Gi - Requires Helm values update

#### 4.3 Operational Handoff üîÆ (Pending)
- Awaiting completion of workload migrations
- Runbooks and documentation to be created

## Current Storage Analysis

### Storage Usage Breakdown
- **Total Provisioned**: 116Gi across 5 PVCs
- **On Ceph**: 6Gi (2 PVCs - 5.2% of total)
- **On Local-Path**: 110Gi (3 PVCs - 94.8% of total)
- **Ceph Capacity**: 5.5 TiB available (0.01% used)

### Workload Classification
- **Infrastructure/Operational**: All 5 workloads
- **Production**: None identified
- **Access Modes**: All RWO (no RWX requirements detected)
- **S3 Requirements**: None detected

## Key Achievements

1. **Ceph Cluster Operational**: Running with HEALTH_OK status
2. **Default Storage Class**: Successfully transitioned to ceph-block
3. **Initial Migrations**: 2 workloads successfully migrated
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Full observability with Grafana/Prometheus
5. **GitOps Ready**: Phased deployment structure with easy activation

## Challenges & Resolutions

1. **Storage Class Conflicts**: Resolved by removing default annotation from local-path
2. **Operator Limitations**: Learned that StatefulSets require full recreation
3. **ClusterID Mismatch**: Fixed by setting clusterName: storage in configuration

## Recommendations & Next Actions

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Complete Remaining Migrations**:
   - Update Airflow Helm values to use ceph-block
   - Update Open WebUI Helm values to use ceph-block
   - Execute migrations using established pattern

2. **Validate Stability**:
   - Monitor migrated workloads for 24-48 hours
   - Check performance metrics in Grafana
   - Verify no data integrity issues

### Short-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Optimize Configuration**:
   - Review and tune Ceph performance settings
   - Consider enabling compression for specific pools
   - Implement backup strategy using Volsync

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create operational runbooks
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Update architecture diagrams

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Capacity Planning**: With 5.5 TiB available, no immediate expansion needed
2. **Feature Activation**: Monitor for RWX or S3 requirements to activate Phase 3
3. **Production Readiness**: Establish 30-day stability period before declaring production-ready

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
- **Low**: Cluster is healthy with good redundancy
- **Medium**: 95% of storage still on local-path (migration in progress)
- **Mitigated**: No data loss risk as no production data identified

### Mitigation Strategies
- Continue phased migration approach
- Maintain ability to rollback via local-path
- Monitor cluster health continuously

## Conclusion

The Ceph implementation is progressing well with the cluster operational and initial migrations successful. The project is on track to complete Phase 4.2 within the next week, after which the system will enter operational validation before final handoff.

**Next Review Date**: 2025-06-16 (after remaining migrations)
