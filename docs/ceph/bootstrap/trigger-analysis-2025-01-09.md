# Ceph Bootstrap Trigger Analysis - January 9, 2025

## Trigger Condition Met: Storage Usage Exceeds 100Gi

### Current State
- **Total Storage Usage**: 116Gi (exceeds 100Gi threshold)
- **Number of PVCs**: 5 persistent volume claims
- **Production Workloads**: Limited production usage
- **RWX Requirements**: None (0 PVCs with ReadWriteMany)
- **S3 Requirements**: None (no S3-related workloads)

### Storage Breakdown
```
PVC Distribution:
- 100Gi: Large allocation (single PVC)
- 8Gi: Medium allocation
- 5Gi: Medium allocation  
- 2Gi: Small allocation
- 1Gi: Small allocation
Total: 116Gi
```

### Workload Analysis
**Current Non-System Workloads:**
- Airflow (scheduler, webserver, statsd)
- Cert-manager components
- CNPG controller
- DragonflyDB operator
- Echo applications (test)

**Assessment**: 
- The 100Gi allocation appears to be a single large PVC, potentially over-provisioned
- Most workloads are operational/infrastructure rather than data-heavy applications
- No clear high-availability requirements identified yet

### Recommendation
**Trigger Status**: âœ… ACTIVATED (storage > 100Gi)

However, before proceeding with full Ceph deployment:
1. **Investigate the 100Gi PVC** - verify if it's actively used or over-allocated
2. **Confirm growth projections** - determine if storage needs will continue growing
3. **Evaluate HA requirements** - assess if current workloads need distributed storage benefits

### Next Steps
With trigger condition met, the initiative can proceed to:
- **Objective 0.2**: Backup current state before any changes
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure preparation when ready to deploy

### Decision Point
The cluster has crossed the storage threshold, but the actual need for distributed storage should be evaluated based on:
- Active storage utilization vs. allocated storage
- Planned workload growth
- High-availability requirements
- Data protection needs beyond simple backups
