# Create Airflow DAGs

I am new to Airflow, so I am going to create a simple DAG to test the waters.

## Example 1: Hello World Hourly

This DAG will print "Hello World!" to the console every hour.

### DAG Configuration

1.  **Enable GitSync**: We've configured Airflow to sync DAGs from a Git repository. The `HelmRelease` for Airflow (typically at `kubernetes/apps/airflow/airflow/app/helmrelease.yaml`) has been updated to include a `dags.gitSync` section. This points to the `kubernetes/apps/airflow/airflow/dags/` directory within your Git repository.

    ```yaml
    # In your helmrelease.yaml values:
    dags:
      gitSync:
        enabled: true
        repo: "https://github.com/wcygan/anton.git" # Or your repo URL
        branch: "main" # Or your default branch
        subPath: "kubernetes/apps/airflow/airflow/dags"
        syncInterval: 60 # Sync every 60 seconds
        # ... other gitSync settings (resources, private repo credentials if needed)
    ```

2.  **Create the DAG file**:
    Create a Python file named `hello_world_dag.py` in the `kubernetes/apps/airflow/airflow/dags/` directory with the following content:

    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations

    import pendulum

    from airflow.models.dag import DAG
    from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

    with DAG(
        dag_id="hello_world",
        schedule="0 * * * *",  # Run hourly at the beginning of the hour
        start_date=pendulum.datetime(2023, 1, 1, tz="UTC"), # Adjust start_date as needed
        catchup=False,
        tags=["example"],
    ) as dag:
        hello_operator = BashOperator(
            task_id="say_hello",
            bash_command='echo "Hello World!"',
        )
    ```

### Deployment

1.  Commit and push these changes (the `helmrelease.yaml` update and the new `hello_world_dag.py` file) to your Git repository.
2.  Flux will automatically sync these changes to your Kubernetes cluster.
3.  Airflow's `git-sync` sidecar will pull the new DAG file into the scheduler and webserver.
4.  You should see the `hello_world` DAG appear in the Airflow UI shortly. It will trigger automatically every hour.

### Verification

1.  Access your Airflow UI (refer to `docs/install-airflow.md` for port-forwarding instructions if needed).
2.  Navigate to the DAGs list. You should see the `hello_world` DAG.
3.  You can manually trigger it or wait for its scheduled run.
4.  Check the logs for the `say_hello` task to see the "Hello World!" output.
