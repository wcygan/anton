- [x] Fix Ceph Storage Warning (Too many PGs per OSD: 284 > max 250) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Backup Solution with Velero ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Stabilize Pod Restarts (investigate and fix high restart counts) ✅ COMPLETED

### Priority 2: Operational Excellence
- [ ] Complete Secrets Migration (12 SOPS → External Secrets/1Password)
- [ ] Configure Prometheus Monitoring & Alerting Rules
- [x] Fix Loki Storage Volume Mount Issues ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Automated Health Monitoring with Airflow ✅ COMPLETED

### Priority 3: Efficiency Improvements
- [x] Implement Resource Requests/Limits for All Workloads ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Optimize Storage Utilization (currently at 0.17%)
- [ ] Create Comprehensive Operational Runbooks

## Implementation Details

### Components to Deploy
- Velero (v1.13+) - Backup and disaster recovery
- Prometheus AlertManager - Alerting configuration
- VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) - Resource recommendations

### Configuration Changes
- Adjust Ceph pool PG configuration to reduce PGs per OSD
- Migrate Loki to Ceph-backed PVC for reliable storage
- Add resource requests/limits to all HelmReleases
- Configure alerting rules for critical metrics

## Validation

### Tests to Perform
- Test 1: Verify Ceph health returns to HEALTH_OK ✅ COMPLETED
- Test 2: Successfully backup and restore a test application with Velero
- Test 3: Confirm pod restart counts stabilize below 5
- Test 4: Validate all secrets accessible via External Secrets
- Test 5: Trigger test alerts and verify delivery

### Metrics
- Cluster Health Score: Target 100% (currently 93%)
- Pod Restart Count: Target <5 per pod (currently up to 98)
- Secret Migration: Target 100% External Secrets (currently 25%)
- Storage Utilization: Target >10% (currently 0.17%)
- Backup Coverage: Target 100% critical apps (currently 0%)

## Lessons Learned

### Current State Analysis
- Strong GitOps foundation with 100% healthy Flux deployments
- Recent successful deployments of Loki+Alloy and Ceph storage
- Well-documented infrastructure with 78 markdown files
- Good hardware resources (3x MS-01, 288GB total RAM, 6TB NVMe)

### Identified Gaps
- No disaster recovery capability poses significant risk
- Pod instability in critical namespaces affects reliability
- Incomplete migration from legacy patterns (SOPS)
- Ceph configuration needs tuning for optimal performance

## Next Steps

### Week 1 (Immediate)
- Execute Ceph PG reconfiguration
- Deploy and configure Velero with S3 backend
- Debug pod restart root causes (OOM, liveness probes, etc.)

### Week 2 (Short-term)
- Complete remaining SOPS to External Secrets migration
- Implement Prometheus alerting rules for all critical services
- Resolve Loki persistent storage issues

### Week 3 (Medium-term)
- Apply resource limits based on VPA recommendations
- Document operational procedures for common tasks
- Deploy external monitoring with Uptime Kuma

## Completion Notes

### Ceph PG Warning Fix (Completed June 11, 2025)
- Reduced total PGs from 569 to 427
- Reduced erasure-coded pool PGs from 256 to 64
- Set pg_num_max limits to prevent autoscaler issues
- Temporarily increased mon_max_pg_per_osd to 260
- Cluster health restored to HEALTH_OK
- Created comprehensive [PG Optimization Guide](../ceph/operations/pg-optimization.md)

### Resource Limits Implementation (Completed June 11, 2025)
- Added comprehensive resource limits to all HelmReleases (27 total)
- **Critical Components Fixed**:
  - kube-prometheus-stack: Added limits for Prometheus (2CPU/4Gi), Grafana (500m/1Gi), AlertManager (200m/256Mi)
  - kubeai-operator: Added limits for operator (500m/512Mi) and open-webui (1CPU/2Gi)
  - volsync: Added limits (200m CPU/512Mi memory)
  - rook-ceph-operator: Added missing limits (500m CPU/512Mi memory)
- **Partial Configurations Fixed**:
  - flux-operator: Added CPU limit (200m)
  - flux-instance: Added CPU limit (500m) 
  - ingress-nginx controllers: Added CPU limits (1CPU) and memory requests (256Mi)
- **Result**: 100% resource limit coverage across all workloads
- **Impact**: Prevents unbounded resource consumption, improves cluster stability

### Pod Restart Stabilization (Completed June 11, 2025)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - Identified OOM kills in Airflow gunicorn processes (multiple workers killed due to memory pressure)
  - CSI plugin restarts caused by k8s API server connectivity timeouts
  - Spegel registry mirror errors (non-fatal, normal operation)
  - Velero ImagePullBackOff due to non-existent kubectl image version
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Increased Airflow webserver memory limit from 2Gi to 4Gi, requests from 512Mi to 1Gi
  - Reduced Airflow gunicorn workers from 4 to 2 to reduce memory pressure
  - Fixed Velero kubectl image from v1.31.3 (non-existent) to v1.33.1
  - Resolved CSI plugin conflicts in Velero configuration
- **Result**: Pod restart counts stabilized, OOM kills eliminated
- **Health Probe Improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive liveness/readiness probes to Airflow (webserver HTTP /health, scheduler job check)
  - Added Loki /ready endpoint probes with S3 initialization delays
  - Added Alloy /-/ready and /-/healthy endpoint monitoring
  - Configured generous failure thresholds (3-5) to prevent false positives during resource pressure
  - Tuned timing for application-specific startup requirements (60-120s initial delays)

### Automated Health Monitoring with Airflow (Completed June 11, 2025)
- **Architecture Implemented**:
  - Daily cluster health monitoring DAG with 4 parallel health checks
  - Real bash scripts replacing simulated checks (k8s, storage, network, flux)
  - ConfigMap-based result storage for historical tracking (30-day retention)
  - Webhook-based alerting system with Prometheus AlertManager integration
- **Health Checks Deployed**:
  - **k8s_health_check.sh**: Node status, unhealthy pods, high restart counts
  - **storage_health_check.sh**: PVC binding status, Ceph cluster health
  - **network_monitor.sh**: Ingress controller health, service endpoints
  - **flux_deployment_check.sh**: Flux components, failed HelmReleases
- **Monitoring Features**:
  - Grafana dashboard with 7 panels for visualization
  - Exit code based severity (0=healthy, 1=warning, 2=critical)
  - Result processing with overall health determination
  - Automatic alerting for critical failures
- **Alerting Configuration**:
  - Python webhook handler deployed (airflow-webhook-handler)
  - Forwards to Prometheus AlertManager at monitoring namespace
  - Optional Slack webhook integration ready
  - Per-task and summary alerts on failures
- **RBAC Configuration**:
  - Created airflow-health-checker ServiceAccount
  - ClusterRole with read permissions across cluster
  - Added pods/exec permission for Ceph health checks
- **Result**: Automated daily health monitoring with historical tracking and alerting

### Velero Backup Solution (Completed June 11, 2025)
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Deployed Velero v1.16.0 with Helm chart 9.2.0
  - Configured Ceph S3 backend using existing RGW endpoint
  - Created automated backup schedules (daily at 2 AM, weekly on Sundays)
  - Integrated with Prometheus for monitoring via ServiceMonitor
- **Architecture Deployed**:
  - Server pod for backup orchestration
  - Node agents (DaemonSet) for filesystem backups
  - S3 bucket "velero" for backup storage
  - CSI snapshot support enabled for PVC backups
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Created comprehensive integration test script
  - Added to test-all.ts framework
  - Supports quick verification and full backup/restore testing
  - Documents manual backup procedures
- **Key Challenges Resolved**:
  - VMware Tanzu repository moved from OCI to HTTPS format
  - Velero v1.14+ includes built-in CSI support (no plugin needed)
  - Credential format conversion from Ceph to AWS S3 format
  - kubectl-based operations (velero CLI not in pod)
- **Documentation Created**:
  - Velero README with architecture and procedures
  - Operations guide with daily/weekly/monthly tasks
  - Backup strategy document comparing Velero vs Volsync
  - Integration test for ongoing verification
- **Result**: Enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery capability operational
