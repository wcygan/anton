# Milestone: Resource Standardization Framework

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Planned

## Summary

Create a comprehensive framework for standardizing Kubernetes resource configurations including limits/requests, security contexts, and monitoring integration across all workloads.

## Goals

- [ ] Define resource tier system (small/medium/large) for consistent sizing
- [ ] Implement security context standards for all workloads
- [ ] Standardize monitoring integration patterns (ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule)
- [ ] Create networking configuration templates (ingress, service patterns)
- [ ] Establish storage configuration standards (Ceph, local-path)
- [ ] Build automated resource validation and compliance checking

## Implementation Details

### Components to Standardize
- Resource limits/requests (2 HelmReleases missing, 4 incomplete)
- Security contexts (pod security standards adoption)
- Monitoring integration (ServiceMonitor patterns across apps)
- Networking configurations (ingress class usage, external-dns)
- Storage patterns (Ceph S3, block storage, local-path)

### Configuration Changes
- Create kubernetes/components/standards/ directory structure
- Define resource tier templates with CPU/memory specifications
- Implement security context component for pod security standards
- Create monitoring integration components
- Build networking pattern templates

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Resource limit compliance checking
- Security context validation
- Monitoring integration verification
- Performance impact assessment

### Metrics
- Resource coverage: Target 100% of workloads with proper limits
- Security compliance: Pod security standards on all workloads
- Monitoring coverage: ServiceMonitor on all user-facing services
- Template reuse: Target 80% of resources using standard components

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Current echo apps demonstrate good security patterns
- Monitoring stack provides excellent observability foundation
- Kustomize components enable effective reuse

### Challenges
- Balancing standardization with application-specific needs
- Ensuring performance requirements are met with standard tiers
- Managing migration without service disruption

## Next Steps

- Phase 1: Define resource tiers and security standards
- Phase 2: Create component templates for common patterns
- Phase 3: Migrate critical applications to standards
- Phase 4: Implement automated compliance validation
