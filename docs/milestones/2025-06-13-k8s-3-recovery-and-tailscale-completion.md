# Milestone: k8s-3 Recovery and Tailscale System Extension Completion

**Date**: 2025-06-13  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

Successfully recovered k8s-3 from a failed Talos upgrade and completed the Tailscale system extension deployment across all cluster nodes. The recovery preserved all Ceph storage data while achieving secure remote cluster management capabilities.

## Goals

- [x] Recover k8s-3 from failed upgrade state
- [x] Restore full cluster functionality (3/3 control plane nodes)
- [x] Complete Tailscale system extension deployment on all nodes
- [x] Achieve secure remote talosctl access via Tailscale network
- [x] Maintain Ceph storage integrity throughout recovery
- [x] Verify all cluster services operational

## Implementation Details

### Components Deployed
- Talos Linux v1.10.4 on k8s-3 with Tailscale extension
- Tailscale system extension v1.84.0 on k8s-2 and k8s-3
- Automatic TLS certificate configuration with Tailscale IPs

### Configuration Changes
- Applied k8s-3 machine configuration from maintenance mode
- Deployed ExtensionServiceConfig patches for Tailscale on k8s-2 and k8s-3
- Automatic certificate SAN inclusion for Tailscale IPs
- Ceph maintenance mode during recovery (noout, norebalance flags)

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Remote talosctl access via Tailscale: ✅ All nodes accessible
- Cluster member queries: ✅ Full cluster visibility
- Ceph health verification: ✅ HEALTH_OK achieved
- OSD recovery: ✅ All 6 OSDs operational
- Monitor quorum: ✅ 3/3 monitors in quorum
- Certificate validation: ✅ TLS works over Tailscale

### Metrics
- Recovery time: ~15 minutes (faster than expected 30+ minutes)
- Data loss: 0% (all Ceph data preserved)
- Cluster availability: Maintained 2/3 nodes throughout
- Tailscale connectivity: 3/3 nodes connected
- Ceph degraded objects: Recovered from 33% to 0%

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Maintenance mode recovery was much faster than full reinstall
- Ceph data preservation during node recovery
- Automatic Tailscale IP inclusion in TLS certificates
- Smooth Tailscale extension deployment across all nodes
- Effective use of Ceph maintenance flags to prevent unnecessary rebalancing

### Challenges
- Initial upgrade failure due to disk mounting errors (`/dev/nvme1n1p5`)
- Required physical intervention to boot into maintenance mode
- Brief confusion about Talos version status in maintenance mode
- Need to understand Ceph's hardware-specific device naming (k8s-3 uses nvme2n1 vs nvme1n1)

## Next Steps

- ✅ Document recovery process for future reference
- ✅ Test complex talosctl operations over Tailscale
- Consider implementing pre-upgrade health checks
- Add monitoring for Tailscale connectivity status
- Evaluate backup strategies for critical cluster state

## Technical Details

### Node Configuration
```yaml
# All nodes now running:
Talos: v1.10.4
Kubernetes: v1.33.1
Tailscale Extension: v1.84.0
```

### Tailscale Network
- k8s-1: 100.106.239.22 (control plane, active)
- k8s-2: 100.107.244.10 (control plane, active)  
- k8s-3: 100.74.207.13 (control plane, active)

### Ceph Recovery Statistics
- OSDs before recovery: 4/6 (2 down on k8s-3)
- OSDs after recovery: 6/6 (all healthy)
- Recovery I/O: ~36 MiB/s during rebalancing
- Final status: HEALTH_OK with no degraded objects
