# Milestone: CLI Framework Expansion

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Planned

## Summary

Expand the existing CLI framework beyond monitoring to include all operational tasks, creating a unified homelab command interface that covers validation, debugging, maintenance, and deployment operations.

## Goals

- [ ] Create unified command structure for all homelab operations
- [ ] Migrate standalone scripts to integrated CLI commands
- [ ] Implement plugin architecture for extensible functionality
- [ ] Establish consistent help and documentation patterns
- [ ] Create command auto-completion and discovery features
- [ ] Integrate with existing monitoring and validation workflows

## Implementation Details

### Components to Expand
- Validation commands (manifest validation, flux config checks)
- Debug commands (deployment tracing, issue analysis)
- Maintenance commands (cleanup operations, node maintenance)
- Deployment commands (1Password setup, component installations)
- Monitoring commands (expand current framework)

### Configuration Changes
- Extend scripts/cli/commands/ structure
- Create plugin registry and loading system
- Implement command categorization and discovery
- Establish consistent argument parsing patterns
- Add command aliasing and shortcuts

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Command integration testing
- Help system validation
- Plugin loading verification
- Backward compatibility checks

### Metrics
- Command coverage: Target 100% of current script functionality
- Response time: Target <500ms for most commands
- Plugin ecosystem: Enable 3rd party extensions
- Documentation coverage: Auto-generated help for all commands

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Current CLI monitoring commands provide good foundation
- Deno ecosystem supports excellent CLI development
- JSON output standardization enables command chaining

### Challenges
- Maintaining consistency across diverse command types
- Balancing feature richness with simplicity
- Ensuring smooth migration from standalone scripts

## Next Steps

- Phase 1: Design command structure and plugin architecture
- Phase 2: Migrate validation and debugging scripts
- Phase 3: Implement maintenance and deployment commands
- Phase 4: Add advanced features (completion, aliases, chaining)
