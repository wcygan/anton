# Milestone: Airflow Deployment Fix

**Date**: 2025-06-13  
**Category**: Application  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

Successfully fixed and deployed Apache Airflow on Kubernetes with proper 1Password secret management integration. Resolved critical issues with 1Password Connect deployment and ExternalSecrets synchronization that were preventing Airflow from starting.

## Goals

- [x] Fix 1Password Connect deployment issues
- [x] Establish proper secret management for Airflow PostgreSQL database
- [x] Get Airflow HelmRelease working correctly with Flux GitOps
- [x] Ensure all Airflow components are running and healthy
- [x] Integrate with existing monitoring and ingress infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### Components Deployed
- Apache Airflow (2.10.5) via Helm chart 1.16.0
- 1Password Connect (1.7.3) for secret management
- PostgreSQL (16.1.0) as Airflow metadata database
- External Secrets Operator integration

### Configuration Changes
- Fixed 1Password Connect credentials deployment using `deno task 1p:install`
- Created `airflow-postgresql` item in 1Password vault with required fields
- Configured ExternalSecret for `airflow-postgresql-secret` synchronization
- Created `airflow-metadata` secret with database connection string
- Reset HelmRelease retry counter by uninstalling and reinstalling
- Configured Kubernetes executor with proper resource limits and Git DAG sync

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- 1Password Connect connectivity: ✅ ClusterSecretStore shows "Ready"
- ExternalSecret sync: ✅ `airflow-postgresql-secret` syncing from 1Password
- Database connectivity: ✅ PostgreSQL pod running and accepting connections
- Airflow components: ✅ All pods (scheduler, webserver, triggerer) running
- HelmRelease status: ✅ Shows "Ready: True" and "InstallSucceeded"

### Metrics
- Pod count: 8/8 running successfully
- HelmRelease failures before fix: 4 attempts
- Time to resolution: ~2 hours
- External secrets sync interval: 1h (configurable)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Systematic troubleshooting approach identified root cause quickly
- 1Password Connect setup script worked perfectly once credentials were available
- ExternalSecret immediately synced once 1Password item was created
- GitOps workflow functioned correctly after clearing failed state

### Challenges
- 1Password Connect requires manual credential deployment (cannot be GitOps managed)
- Airflow Helm chart expects `airflow-metadata` secret but doesn't auto-create it when using external PostgreSQL auth
- HelmRelease retry exhaustion required manual reset via uninstall/reinstall
- Field names in 1Password must match exactly (case-sensitive) with ExternalSecret property mappings

## Next Steps

- Monitor Airflow deployment for stability over next 24-48 hours
- Add proper 1Password items for other failing ExternalSecrets across cluster
- Consider creating ExternalSecret for `airflow-metadata` to fully automate secret management
- Test DAG deployment and execution workflows
- Verify ingress access and SSL certificate generation
