## Project Context

This project is based on https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template to setup a Talos Linux Kubernetes cluster in my homelab.

## Hardware

I have 3 Minisforum MS-01 mini PCs. I'd like them to be named k8s-1, k8s-2, k8s-3

Their IPs are:

1. 192.168.1.98
2. 192.168.1.99
3. 192.168.1.100

For each of the machines, it is possible to get their disk and mac address as follows:

```bash
talosctl -n 192.168.1.99 get disks --insecure
talosctl -n 192.168.1.99 get links --insecure
```

## Network Setup

My network gateway is available at 192.168.1.254

## Talos Setup

The Talos schematic is `064d2c892ac9a3a7da7fa550dbdd1516908bd9dfe355ad345ff4e9d8f8b34930`
