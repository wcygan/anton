# Searching the Examples for Guidance

Whenever you need to implement additions or modifications to your Talos/Kubernetes cluster, search the complete example definitions in the `/examples` folder:

- [examples/onedr0p-home-ops.md](mdc:examples/onedr0p-home-ops.md)
- [examples/Tanguille-cluster.md](mdc:examples/Tanguille-cluster.md)
- [examples/joryirving-home-ops.md](mdc:examples/joryirving-home-ops.md)
- [examples/JJGadgets-Biohazard.md](mdc:examples/JJGadgets-Biohazard.md)

These files include end-to-end directory layouts, Flux `Kustomization` CRs, HelmRelease patterns, SOPS secret conventions, and ConfigMapGenerator usage. Refer to them to ensure consistency with established GitOps/Kustomizeâ€“Flux patterns.
