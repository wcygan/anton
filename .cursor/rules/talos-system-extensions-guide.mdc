# Talos Linux System Extensions Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install system extensions into Talos Linux, allowing for customization of the root filesystem while maintaining its immutability.

## Overview

System extensions enable features like custom container runtimes or additional firmware. They are activated during Talos installation or upgrade. Even with extensions, the Talos root filesystem remains immutable and read-only.

Since Talos v1.5.0, boot media (ISOs, PXE images, disk images) can be generated with extensions pre-included. This simplifies the process as it removes the need to rebuild the `initramfs.xz` on the machine itself during installation or upgrade.

## Installation Methods

There are primarily two scenarios for installing system extensions:

1.  **During Initial Installation (e.g., from ISO or PXE):**
    *   Some extensions, like network drivers, might be needed for the initial boot and installation process. These should be included in the initial boot assets.
    *   Other extensions (e.g., NVIDIA drivers, gVisor) are only needed after Talos is installed on disk. These can be included in the `installer` image.

2.  **For Pre-Installed Disk Images (e.g., AMIs, VMDKs):**
    *   Extensions can be directly baked into the disk image.

The general approach involves using a custom `installer` container image.

### Using a Custom `installer` Image

This is a common method, especially when booting from generic media like an ISO.

1.  **Prepare a Custom `installer` Image:**
    *   A Talos system extension is essentially a container image with a specific directory structure. You can build your own or use pre-built extensions (e.g., from the [Sidero Labs extensions repository](mdc:https:/github.com/siderolabs/extensions/blob/main/README.md)).
    *   Create a new `installer` container image that includes the desired system extension(s). The process for generating boot assets with extensions is detailed in the [Talos boot assets guide](mdc:https:/www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/installation/boot-assets).
    *   Push this custom `installer` image to a container registry accessible by your Talos nodes.

2.  **Configure Machine Installation:**
    *   In your Talos machine configuration file (e.g., `controlplane.yaml`, `worker.yaml`), specify your custom `installer` image in the `.machine.install.image` field.
        ```yaml
        machine:
          install:
            image: your-registry/custom-talos-installer-with-extensions:tag
            # ... other install options
        ```

3.  **Installation Process:**
    *   **Boot from Generic Media (if applicable):** Boot the machine using a standard Talos ISO or PXE image.
    *   **Apply Machine Configuration:** Apply the machine configuration that points to your custom `installer` image.
    *   **Installation with Extensions:** Talos will pull the specified custom `installer` image. This installer, now containing your system extension(s), will proceed to install Talos (with those extensions) onto the machine's disk.
    *   **Reboot:** The machine reboots into Talos with the system extensions active.

### Using a Custom Disk Image (e.g., for Cloud VMs)

1.  **Prepare a Custom Disk Image:**
    *   Generate a Talos disk image (e.g., AMI for AWS, VMDK for VMware) that includes the system extension(s). Refer to the [Talos boot assets guide](mdc:https:/www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/installation/boot-assets) for creating custom images.
    *   Upload this image to your cloud provider or hypervisor.

2.  **Launch Machine:**
    *   Launch a new virtual machine using the custom disk image. Talos will boot with the extensions already included.

## Upgrading Talos with System Extensions

When upgrading Talos on a machine that uses system extensions:

*   **If using the `installer` image method:** Generate a new custom `installer` container image for the new Talos version, including the same (or updated) system extensions. Push it to your registry. Update the `.machine.install.image` in the machine configuration (or use the `--image` flag with `talosctl upgrade`) to point to this new installer image.
*   **If using custom disk images:** You can either replace the VM with a new one built from an updated disk image or use the custom `installer` image method for an in-place upgrade.

## Verifying Installed Extensions

You can list the system extensions active on a Talos node using `talosctl`:

```bash
talosctl get extensions -n <NODE_IP_OR_NAME>
```

To see more details about a specific extension:

```bash
talosctl get extensions <EXTENSION_ID> -n <NODE_IP_OR_NAME> -o yaml
```

## Authoring System Extensions

System extensions are container images with a specific folder structure. For details on creating your own extensions, refer to the official Talos documentation on [Authoring System Extensions](mdc:https:/www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/configuration/system-extensions/#authoring-system-extensions). Sidero Labs also maintains a [repository of common extensions](mdc:https:/github.com/siderolabs/extensions/blob/main/README.md).
