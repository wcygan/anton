# Project Origin and Context

This project is a homelab setup for a Talos Linux Kubernetes cluster. It is derived from the onedr0p/cluster-template.

The specific configuration and customization for this homelab instance are detailed in the project's main `[README.md](mdc:README.md)`, which outlines how the `onedr0p/cluster-template` is utilized.

Key aspects of the setup, as inherited or adapted from the template, include:
- **Templating Engine**: makejinja processes files for cluster and nodes to generate deployment configurations.
- **Core Technologies**:
    - Talos Linux for the operating system.
    - Flux for GitOps.
    - Sops for managing secrets.
    - cloudflared for external network access to applications.
