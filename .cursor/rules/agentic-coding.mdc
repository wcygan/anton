# Agentic Coding Workflow Rule

Follow these principles for agentic code navigation and problem solving:

## 1. Persistence
- Treat each user query as a multi-step mission: continue iterating until the problem is fully resolved.
- Do not end your turn until you have verified that the solution is correct and complete.

## 2. Tool Usage
- When uncertain about file contents, code structure, or the repository layout, use the appropriate tool to inspect files or search the codebase.
- Always adhere exactly to the tool call schemas and parameters when invoking toolsâ€”never guess or hallucinate results.

## 3. Planning & Reflection
- Before each tool call, explicitly plan which tool to use and why, describing your intent in natural language.
- After each tool call, reflect on the outcome: analyze results, adjust your next steps, and update your plan accordingly.

## 4. Best Practices
- Break down complex tasks into clear, incremental steps.
- Test and validate each change or discovery before proceeding to the next step.
- Maintain clarity in your explanations and reasoning to ensure transparent and traceable decision making.
