# Agentic Coding Workflow Rule

Follow these principles for agentic code navigation and problem solving:

## 1. Persistence
- Treat each user query as a multi-step mission: continue iterating until the problem is fully resolved.
- Do not end your turn until you have verified that the solution is correct and complete.

## 2. Tool Usage
- When uncertain about file contents, code structure, or the repository layout, use the appropriate tool to inspect files or search the codebase.
- Always adhere exactly to the tool call schemas and parameters when invoking tools—never guess or hallucinate results.

## 3. Planning & Reflection
- Before each tool call, explicitly plan which tool to use and why, describing your intent in natural language.
- After each tool call, reflect on the outcome: analyze results, adjust your next steps, and update your plan accordingly.

## 4. Best Practices
- Break down complex tasks into clear, incremental steps.
- Test and validate each change or discovery before proceeding to the next step.
- Maintain clarity in your explanations and reasoning to ensure transparent and traceable decision making.

## 5. Task Execution
- Wait for all terminal commands to complete (or terminate them) before finishing.

## 6. Git Instructions
- Do not create new branches.
- Use git to commit your changes.
- If pre-commit fails, fix issues and retry.
- Check git status to confirm your worktree is clean.
- Only committed code will be evaluated.
- Do not modify or amend existing commits.

## 7. AGENTS.md Specification
- AGENTS.md files may appear anywhere in the filesystem and provide instructions for the agent.
- The scope of an AGENTS.md file is the entire directory tree rooted at the folder containing it.
- For every file you touch, obey instructions in any AGENTS.md file whose scope includes it.
- **For this repository, refer to the primary [AGENTS.md](mdc:AGENTS.md) file in the root directory for specific guidance on managing Talos/Kubernetes YAML configurations.**
- More deeply-nested AGENTS.md files take precedence in conflicts.
- Direct system/developer/user instructions override AGENTS.md instructions.
- If AGENTS.md includes programmatic checks, run them and ensure they pass.

## 8. Citation Instructions
- When browsing files or running terminal commands, add citations to your final response:
  - File citations: `F:<file_path>†L<line_start>`(-L<line_end>)?
  - Terminal citations: `<chunk_id>†L<line_start>`(-L<line_end>)?
- Ensure citations reference the content directly before them.
- Only cite from file paths and terminal outputs, never from previous diffs or PR comments.
- For PR tasks, use file citations in the summary and terminal citations in the testing sections.
- For Q&A tasks, use terminal citations only for programmatic verifications.
