# 1Password Secrets Policy

All new Kubernetes Secrets must be provisioned and managed through the 1Password Operator via `OnePasswordItem` CustomResources.

- Do not commit or store plain Secret manifests containing unencrypted or manually created data.
- Define a `OnePasswordItem` CR to sync the secret from 1Password into a Kubernetes Secret.
- Reference the synced Secret in your application manifests via `valuesFrom` or `env.valueFrom.secretKeyRef`.

For implementation details, see the 1Password integration plan: [plans/plan-to-add-1password.md](mdc:plans/plan-to-add-1password.md)
