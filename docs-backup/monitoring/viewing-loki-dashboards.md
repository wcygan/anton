## Quick Checks

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check dashboard ConfigMaps
kubectl get cm -n monitoring | grep grafana-dashboard

# See dashboard labels (these trigger auto-import)
kubectl describe cm grafana-dashboard-loki -n monitoring | grep -A3 Labels

# Check Grafana sidecar logs (it imports dashboards)
kubectl logs -n monitoring deployment/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -c grafana-sc-dashboard --tail=20
```

   kubectl rollout restart deployment/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring
   ```
