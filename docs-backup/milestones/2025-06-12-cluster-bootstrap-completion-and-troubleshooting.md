# Milestone: Cluster Bootstrap Completion and Troubleshooting

**Date**: 2025-06-13  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

Successfully resolved critical cluster bootstrap failures and completed the full GitOps deployment pipeline for the Anton homelab cluster. This milestone involved troubleshooting external-dns CRD compatibility issues, implementing 1Password Connect for secret management, and establishing a fully operational Kubernetes cluster with comprehensive application stack deployment.

## Goals

- [x] Resolve bootstrap failure blocking application deployment
- [x] Complete external-dns CRD compatibility issue
- [x] Deploy and configure 1Password Connect for secret management
- [x] Enable full GitOps pipeline for application deployment
- [x] Document troubleshooting process and solutions
- [x] Verify core infrastructure services are operational

## Implementation Details

### Components Deployed
- External Secrets Operator v0.17.0 (with v0.16.1 CRDs)
- 1Password Connect v1.7.3 (Helm chart v1.17.0)
- CNPG (CloudNative PostgreSQL) Operator v0.24.0
- Nessie Data Catalog v0.104.1
- Kube Prometheus Stack v72.9.1
- Rook-Ceph Operator and Cluster v1.17.4
- KubeAI Operator v0.21.0 (in progress)
- Loki Logging Stack v6.30.1 (in progress)

### Configuration Changes
- Reverted external-dns CRD URL from v0.17.0 to v0.16.1 in `scripts/bootstrap-apps.sh`
- Added explanatory comments about CRD version compatibility
- Created ClusterSecretStore for 1Password integration
- Deployed cluster-secrets ExternalSecrets across all 12 namespaces
- Updated Claude Code settings for enhanced GitHub API access

### Secret Management Infrastructure
- 1Password Connect server deployed in external-secrets namespace
- ClusterSecretStore configured for "anton" vault access
- ExternalSecret resources syncing cluster-secrets to all namespaces
- API token securely stored in Kubernetes secret

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Cilium CNI status: âœ… All nodes Ready, 3/3 agents running
- Flux system health: âœ… All controllers operational
- GitOps sync: âœ… cluster-apps kustomization deploying successfully
- Secret sync: âœ… All 12 namespaces receiving cluster-secrets from 1Password
- Storage deployment: âœ… Rook-Ceph cluster operational
- Monitoring stack: âœ… Prometheus and Grafana deployed

### Metrics
- Cluster nodes: 3/3 Ready
- Application namespaces: 12 with secrets synced
- HelmReleases deployed: 6+ major services
- GitOps reconciliation: cluster-apps Ready
- Bootstrap completion time: ~45 minutes from failure to resolution

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **Systematic troubleshooting approach**: Used deep-dive methodology to identify root causes rather than applying quick fixes
- **Real-time documentation**: Created comprehensive troubleshooting guides during problem resolution
- **MCP integration**: Leveraged Kubernetes MCP server for efficient cluster introspection
- **GitOps dependency understanding**: Successfully mapped and resolved circular dependencies in application deployment

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: External-DNS CRD Compatibility
**Issue**: Bootstrap failed with 404 error when trying to download external-dns v0.17.0 CRD manifest
**Root Cause**: Renovate auto-updated external-dns from v0.16.1 to v0.17.0, but v0.17.0 removed the CRD manifest file
**Resolution**: 
- Investigated git history to identify problematic Renovate commit
- Verified v0.16.1 CRD URL still functional
- Reverted to working v0.16.1 URL with explanatory comments
- Added note about upstream project CRD removal

#### Challenge 2: Circular GitOps Dependencies  
**Issue**: cluster-apps kustomization failed because ExternalSecret resources couldn't be applied without External Secrets Operator CRDs
**Root Cause**: Flux attempts to apply all resources simultaneously, but applications needed secrets before secret provider was ready
**Resolution**:
- Manually deployed external-secrets kustomization first to install CRDs
- Allowed ExternalSecret resources to be processed
- Full reconciliation then succeeded for all applications

#### Challenge 3: 1Password Connect Integration
**Issue**: Applications failed with "cluster-secrets not found" errors even after External Secrets Operator was running
**Root Cause**: 1Password Connect backend not available to provide actual secret values
**Resolution**:
- Used `deno task 1p:install` to deploy 1Password Connect
- Performed clean uninstall/reinstall to resolve transient state issues
- Verified ClusterSecretStore connectivity to "anton" vault
- Confirmed ExternalSecret resources successfully synced across all namespaces

## Technical Deep Dive

### Bootstrap Sequence Resolution
The solution required understanding the proper bootstrap sequence:
1. **Essential services** (Cilium, CoreDNS, cert-manager) - deployed via Helmfile
2. **Secret management foundation** (External Secrets Operator) - deployed manually first
3. **Secret backend** (1Password Connect) - deployed via deno task
4. **Full application stack** - deployed via GitOps once secrets available

### GitOps Architecture Understanding
- **cluster-meta**: Manages Helm repositories and foundational resources
- **cluster-apps**: Orchestrates all application deployments with dependency management
- **Individual kustomizations**: Deploy specific applications with proper dependencies

### External Secrets Integration Pattern
```
1Password Vault ("anton") â†’ 1Password Connect â†’ ClusterSecretStore â†’ ExternalSecret â†’ Kubernetes Secret
```

## Next Steps

- **Monitor Loki deployment**: Complete logging stack installation (currently in progress)
- **Fix 1Password Connect HelmRelease**: Investigate and resolve "services not found" error
- **Implement bootstrap validation**: Add URL validation and dependency checks to bootstrap script
- **Create disaster recovery procedures**: Document recovery processes for secret management failures
- **Establish monitoring dashboards**: Configure Grafana dashboards for cluster health monitoring
