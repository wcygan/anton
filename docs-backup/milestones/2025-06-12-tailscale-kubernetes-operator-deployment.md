# Milestone: Tailscale Kubernetes Operator Deployment

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Successfully deployed Tailscale Kubernetes Operator to enable secure remote access to the homelab cluster. This addresses the #1 priority for remote cluster recovery and provides zero-trust network access to internal services.

## Goals

- [x] Deploy Tailscale Kubernetes Operator using existing installation scripts
- [x] Set up OAuth credentials for secure authentication
- [x] Verify operator functionality and ingress class availability
- [x] Enable existing Tailscale ingress resources for key services
- [x] Establish remote cluster access capability

## Implementation Details

### Components Deployed
- Tailscale Kubernetes Operator (latest from Helm chart)
- OAuth credential management system
- Tailscale IngressClass controller

### Configuration Changes
- Created `tailscale` namespace
- Deployed operator via Helm with OAuth credentials
- Configured kubeconfig for Tailscale access
- Activated 5 pre-configured Tailscale ingress resources

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Operator pod status: Running and healthy
- IngressClass availability: `tailscale` class active
- Service exposure: 5 services automatically exposed via Tailscale
- Log analysis: Operator functioning correctly (minor expected warnings for non-existent services)

### Metrics
- Installation time: ~8 minutes
- Services exposed: 5 (Grafana, Ceph Dashboard, Ceph S3, KubeAI API, Open WebUI)
- Operator pods: 1/1 Ready
- Tailscale proxy pods: 5/5 Running

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Comprehensive installation scripts worked flawlessly
- OAuth credential setup was secure and automated
- Existing ingress resources became functional immediately
- kubeconfig integration worked seamlessly

### Challenges
- Initial kubectx confusion caused timeout errors during verification
- Minor operator warnings about missing Loki services (expected, services not deployed yet)

## Next Steps

- Test remote access to exposed services via Tailscale hostnames
- Configure additional services for Tailscale exposure as needed
- Monitor operator performance and resource usage
- Consider implementing Tailscale ACLs for enhanced security
