# Milestone: Cluster Reset and Recovery

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

Complete reset and recovery of the Anton Kubernetes cluster after failed recovery attempt from cluster-apps kustomization deletion. The cluster experienced cascading failures due to dependency ordering issues during bulk resource creation.

## Goals

- [x] Execute full cluster reset via `task talos:reset`
- [ ] Regenerate cluster configuration files (cluster.yaml, nodes.yaml)
- [ ] Bootstrap Talos Linux on all nodes
- [ ] Deploy core infrastructure components (Cilium, CoreDNS, Flux)
- [ ] Restore GitOps synchronization
- [ ] Verify all applications are deployed and healthy

## Implementation Details

### Background
- Initial incident: Accidental deletion of cluster-apps kustomization terminated ~80 pods
- Recovery attempt failed due to:
  - Storage namespace stuck in terminating state for 10 days
  - ExternalSecret CRD dependencies not satisfied
  - Drift detection timeout after 59.5 minutes

### Reset Process
- Executed `task talos:reset` to wipe all nodes back to maintenance mode
- All Kubernetes data destroyed
- Nodes reset to factory state

### Configuration Changes
- Will regenerate cluster.yaml and nodes.yaml from templates
- Maintain existing age.key for secret decryption
- Preserve Git repository state

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Node connectivity: TBD
- Talos health check: TBD
- Kubernetes API availability: TBD
- Pod count restoration: TBD

### Metrics
- Initial pod count: 100+
- Post-incident pod count: 23
- Post-reset pod count: 0
- Target pod count: 100+

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Talos reset command worked as expected
- Configuration files and secrets preserved
- Git repository maintained desired state

### Challenges
- Storage namespace termination blocked recovery for hours
- Dependency ordering in cluster-apps caused repeated failures
- Drift detection timeout made troubleshooting difficult

## Next Steps

- Create cluster.yaml and nodes.yaml configuration files
- Run `task configure` to generate Talos configs
- Execute `task bootstrap:talos` for node initialization
- Execute `task bootstrap:apps` for core services
- Monitor deployment and verify all services recover
