# Milestone: Airflow Vector Logging Verification

**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Category**: Monitoring  
**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

Implementing comprehensive verification of the Vector sidecar logging solution for Airflow KubernetesExecutor task pods to ensure 100% log capture from ephemeral containers.

## Goals

- [ ] Verify Vector sidecar is deployed in all task pods (2 containers: base + vector)
- [ ] Confirm all log messages from Python tasks are captured (logger + print statements)
- [ ] Validate logs are successfully ingested into Loki
- [ ] Create automated verification script for ongoing validation
- [ ] Document any configuration fixes needed for Vector

## Implementation Details

### Components Deployed
- Vector sidecar (v0.39.0-debian) - Log collector embedded in task pods
- Pod template configuration - Defines Vector sidecar alongside task container
- Verification script - Automated testing of log pipeline

### Configuration Changes
- Fixed HelmRelease schema validation errors
- Embedded pod template directly in HelmRelease values
- Escaped template variables to prevent Helm parsing conflicts
- Removed artificial 5-second delays from DAGs

## Validation

### Tests Performed
- Test 1: Vector sidecar deployment - Checking for 2-container pods
- Test 2: Task execution - Triggering hello_world DAG
- Test 3: Pod log capture - Verifying expected messages in container logs
- Test 4: Vector health - Checking sidecar logs for errors
- Test 5: Loki ingestion - Querying for specific log messages

### Expected Log Messages
```python
logger.info("This is an INFO log message from Python task")
logger.warning("This is a WARNING log message from Python task")
logger.error("This is an ERROR log message from Python task")
print("This is a print statement that should appear in logs")
print("Testing log persistence with multiple lines")
```

### Metrics
- Log capture rate: Target 100% (up from <10% with Alloy-only)
- Task latency reduction: 5 seconds (removed artificial delays)
- Resource overhead: 5m CPU, 20Mi memory per task pod

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Vector sidecar architecture successfully deployed
- Pod template integration working with KubernetesExecutor
- Removed race condition between pod lifecycle and log collection

### Challenges
- Cluster connectivity issues during verification (cluster temporarily down)
- Vector configuration syntax errors in initial deployment
- Template variable escaping required for Helm compatibility

## Next Steps

- Run comprehensive verification once cluster is back online
- Fix any Vector configuration issues identified
- Monitor resource usage over 24-hour period
- Create Grafana dashboard for Vector sidecar health metrics
- Document operational procedures for troubleshooting
