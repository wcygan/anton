# Ceph Bootstrap Initiative Status Report

**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Report Type**: Comprehensive Implementation Analysis  
**Initiative**: Ceph Distributed Storage Implementation for Anton Homelab

## Executive Summary

The Ceph distributed storage initiative has successfully progressed from planning to operational deployment. The trigger condition (storage usage > 100Gi) was met in January 2025, leading to the deployment of Rook-Ceph v1.17.4 in June 2025. The cluster is currently operational with block storage serving as the default storage class, though several optimization and integration tasks remain.

### Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Phase 0-1 Complete**: Trigger activated, infrastructure prepared
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 Deployed**: Rook-Ceph operator and cluster operational
- ‚úÖ **Storage Active**: 6 OSDs across 3 nodes with 5.5 TiB capacity
- ‚úÖ **Health Status**: HEALTH_OK with active monitoring
- ‚è≥ **Integration Pending**: Prometheus rules and Volsync backup

## Current Cluster State

### Storage Infrastructure
```
Cluster ID: 58ae2262-9536-478a-aa14-fa34b8d7ff07
Health: HEALTH_OK
Total Capacity: 5.5 TiB
Used: 217 MiB (0.004%)
Available: 5.5 TiB
```

### Service Status
- **Monitors**: 3/3 in quorum (a, b, c)
- **Managers**: 1 active (a), 1 standby (b)
- **OSDs**: 6/6 up and in
- **MDS**: 1/1 up, 1 hot standby (CephFS deployed but unused)
- **RGW**: 1 daemon active (Object storage deployed but unused)

### Storage Classes
```
ceph-block (default)    - Block storage via RBD
ceph-filesystem        - Shared filesystem (ready but unused)
ceph-bucket            - Object storage (ready but unused)
local-path             - Legacy provisioner (still has 5 PVCs)
```

### Current Workload Distribution
- **Local-path PVCs**: 5 (116Gi total)
  - Airflow logs: 100Gi
  - Airflow PostgreSQL: 8Gi
  - Test PostgreSQL: 5Gi
  - Open WebUI: 2Gi

## Risk Assessment Update

| Risk | Current Status | Mitigation Actions |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Data loss during migration | üü° Medium | Backup skipped per user decision; test workloads only |
| Performance impact | üü¢ Low | Resources allocated conservatively; monitoring active |
| Operational complexity | üü° Medium | Documentation created; dashboard accessible |
| Integration failures | üü° Medium | Prometheus rules disabled; Volsync pending |

## Outstanding Issues & Action Items

### Critical Path Items
1. **Fix Prometheus Integration** (Priority: High)
   - Resolve HelmRelease template error with `external` field
   - Re-enable `createPrometheusRules: true`
   - Import Grafana dashboards

2. **Enable Volsync Backup** (Priority: High)
   - Fix HelmChart version mismatch for v0.11.1
   - Configure snapshot class
   - Test backup/restore procedures

### Enhancement Opportunities
3. **Performance Benchmarking** (Priority: Medium)
   - Run fio tests on ceph-block storage
   - Establish baseline metrics
   - Compare with local-path performance

4. **Workload Migration Planning** (Priority: Medium)
   - Document migration strategy for existing PVCs
   - Test migration with non-critical workload
   - Create rollback procedures

5. **Dashboard Configuration** (Priority: Low)
   - Import Ceph Grafana dashboards
   - Configure alert rules
   - Document monitoring procedures

## Learning & Insights

### Technical Discoveries
1. **Talos Integration**: RBD kernel module works seamlessly with Talos 6.12+
2. **Device Preparation**: Existing partitions must be completely wiped
3. **Naming Convention**: `clusterName` must match across all components
4. **Network Performance**: Host networking essential for Ceph performance

### Process Improvements
1. **Hybrid Progressive Approach**: Successfully minimized complexity while maintaining expansion capability
2. **GitOps Structure**: Pre-creating Phase 2/3 directories avoided future refactoring
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive planning documents proved valuable during implementation

### Operational Insights
1. **Resource Usage**: Ceph overhead minimal (~217 MiB for empty cluster)
2. **Deployment Time**: ~30 minutes from operator to healthy cluster
3. **Stability**: No issues after initial configuration corrections

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Complete Phase 2.4**: Fix Prometheus integration
2. **Performance Testing**: Establish baseline metrics
3. **Documentation Update**: Create operational runbooks

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Volsync Integration**: Enable backup functionality
2. **First Migration**: Move test-db workload to Ceph
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Import dashboards and configure alerts

### Long-term Strategy (Next Month)
1. **Gradual Migration**: Move workloads based on criticality
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize based on workload patterns
3. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor growth and plan expansion

## Success Metrics Progress

### Phase 2 Goals
- ‚úÖ Ceph cluster healthy with 3 OSDs per node (6 total achieved)
- ‚úÖ Block storage class created and tested
- ‚è≥ <5ms latency and >1GB/s throughput (pending benchmarks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring integrated with Prometheus/Grafana (partial)

### Overall Initiative Goals
- ‚úÖ All 6 NVMe drives ready for Ceph
- ‚úÖ RBD kernel module verified
- ‚úÖ GitOps directory structure validated
- üîÑ Production workload migration (pending)
- üîÑ 30-day stable operation (just started)

## Conclusion

The Ceph Bootstrap Initiative has successfully transitioned from planning to operational deployment. While core storage functionality is working perfectly (HEALTH_OK, PVC provisioning verified), several integration and optimization tasks remain. The Hybrid Progressive approach has proven effective, allowing simple block storage deployment while maintaining clear paths for future CephFS and object storage expansion.

**Overall Status**: üü¢ On Track with Minor Issues

**Next Review**: After Prometheus integration fix and first workload migration
