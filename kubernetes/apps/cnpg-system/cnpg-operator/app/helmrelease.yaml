  # Default values are generally fine for the operator itself.
  # The operator will be installed in the cnpg-system namespace as defined in ks.yaml
  # and this HelmRelease metadata.namespace.
  values:
    # Per documentation, the default deployment name for Helm installs is cnpg-cloudnative-pg
    # However, the ks.yaml health check expects cnpg-controller-manager, which is the default for manifest installs.
    # To align with the health check and common practice for manifest-based operator installs (which Helm often wraps):
    fullnameOverride: cnpg-controller-manager
    # For a test setup, we can disable metrics to reduce resource footprint further if not needed.
