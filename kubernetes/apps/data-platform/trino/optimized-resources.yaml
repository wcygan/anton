      values:
        coordinator:
          jvm:
            maxHeapSize: "3G"  # Reduced from 4G - coordinator typically uses less
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "500m"      # Reduced from 1000m - coordinator is mostly coordination
              memory: "3Gi"    # Aligned with heap size
            limits:
              cpu: "1500m"     # Reduced from 2000m

            requests:
              cpu: "1000m"     # Reduced from 1500m - better for scheduling

            limits:
              cpu: "2000m"     # Reduced from 3000m - still allows bursts
              memory: "5Gi"    # Reduced from 6Gi - 1G overhead for non-heap
