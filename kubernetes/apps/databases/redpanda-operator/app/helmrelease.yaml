    # Redpanda Operator configuration
    # The operator is namespace-scoped and manages Redpanda clusters
    # in the same namespace where it's deployed (databases)

    # CRDs are managed via install.crds above (v25.1.1+ supports this)
    # No additional configuration needed for operator-only deployment
