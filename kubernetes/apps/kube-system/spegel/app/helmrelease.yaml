      # WHY: Explicitly list registries for Spegel to mirror.
      # Without this, Spegel uses _default which intercepts ALL registries
      # including Harbor, but can't fallback to non-standard registries after 404.
      # Harbor registry is included so Spegel manages its hosts.toml —
      # with prependExisting, the Talos-level Harbor mirror is preserved
      # as a fallback after Spegel's P2P layer.

      # WHY: Preserve Talos-managed containerd mirror configs (e.g. Harbor registry)
      # that Spegel doesn't manage. Without this, Spegel backs up and removes
      # non-Spegel host configs from /etc/cri/conf.d/hosts/ after node resets.
