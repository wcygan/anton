  - Core controller for managing SparkApplication lifecycle
  - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Spark job management
  - RBAC configuration with proper service accounts
  - Prometheus ServiceMonitor for metrics collection
  - Support for Spark 3.5.5

#### Technical Details
- Deployed to `data-platform` namespace
- Image: `ghcr.io/kubeflow/spark-operator/controller:2.2.0` 
- Resource limits: 500m CPU, 512Mi memory
- Webhook temporarily disabled for stability (to be re-enabled)

#### Known Issues
- Webhook port conflict resolved by disabling webhook
- Image registry path required correction from Docker Hub to ghcr.io

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive GitOps implementation guide
- Added data platform README with architecture overview
- Documented manual prerequisites and compliance gaps

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-15

### Phase 1: Foundation Completed

#### Added

##### S3 Storage Validation (Objective 1.1)
- Validated Ceph S3 compatibility with Apache Iceberg
- Created test scripts for S3 operations
- Established performance baselines
- **Note**: Proceeded without meeting 200Gi threshold per user decision

##### Nessie Catalog Configuration (Objective 1.2) 
- Deployed Project Nessie as Iceberg catalog service
- Configured PostgreSQL backend using CNPG operator
- REST API endpoint available at port 19120
- Integrated with Ceph S3 object storage

##### Iceberg Table Operations (Objective 1.3)
- Created Spark-Iceberg client pod for testing
- Successfully tested table creation (infrastructure ready)
- Downloaded required Iceberg runtime JARs
- **Issue**: Minor catalog registration issue in Spark SQL

##### Metadata Backup Procedures (Objective 1.4)
- Implemented automated daily backups via CronJob
- PostgreSQL dumps stored on PVC (10Gi)
- Created comprehensive backup/recovery documentation
- Validated restore procedures

#### Changed
- Switched from Apache Polaris to Project Nessie for catalog service
  - Reason: Lack of pre-built Polaris images
  - Nessie provides Git-like versioning capabilities

#### Technical Stack
- **Catalog**: Project Nessie 0.104.1
- **Storage**: Ceph RADOS Gateway (S3-compatible)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (via CNPG)
- **Container Runtime**: Kubernetes 1.32.1
- **GitOps**: Flux v2.5.1

## [0.0.1] - 2025-01-11

### Initial Bootstrap Planning

#### Added
- Created phased deployment plan (4 phases, 19 objectives)
- Defined resource requirements and trigger conditions
- Established GitOps structure for deployments
- Created bootstrap documentation framework

#### Phases Defined
1. **Foundation**: S3 storage, catalog service, basic operations
2. **Compute Platform**: Spark Operator and job management  
3. **Analytics Engine**: Trino cluster for SQL queries
4. **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, backups, optimization

#### Resource Allocation
- Total platform: 70GB RAM, 15 CPU cores, 500GB storage
- Conservative estimates with 30% buffer
- Phased rollout to manage resource consumption
